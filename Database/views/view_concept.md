# Views 

- []()
- Only `Select` can be used for views `no any DML` works in it .
- We make Views just like function we can call multiple times  .
- Virtual Table are also known as `base table` .
- Users can only retrieve data in read-only view but cannot update it.

- Key Points :
  - Security 
  - Abstraction (let say there are three table you pick selected data from it and show it , Which means all tables are hidden from normal user)
  - Simplisity
