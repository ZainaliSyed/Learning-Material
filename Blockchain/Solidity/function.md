# Functions

- Functions are of two types internal and external
- Functions can be specified as being **(know as visibility specifier)** `external, public, internal or private`, where the default is public. For state variables, external is not possible and the default is internal.
- function syntax can be written as

```
function (<parameter types>) {internal|external} [pure|constant|view|payable] [returns (<return types>)]
```
