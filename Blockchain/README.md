- `Transactions` are grouped into “blocks.” A block contains a series of transactions, and each block is chained together with its previous block.
- For a transaction to be considered valid, it must go through a validation process known as `mining`.
- #`proof of work` : The process of validating each block by having a miner provide a mathematical proof is known as a “proof of work.”
# Etherum mechanism
- `GHOST protocol` “GHOST” = “Greedy Heaviest Observed Subtree”
