- Transactions are grouped into “blocks.” A block contains a series of transactions, and each block is chained together with its previous block.
- For a transaction to be considered valid, it must go through a validation process known as mining.
- #`proof of work` : The process of validating each block by having a miner provide a mathematical proof is known as a “proof of work.”
