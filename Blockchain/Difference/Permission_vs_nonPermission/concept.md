# Public and Private

- `Private or permissioned blockchains` operate similarly to public blockchains but have access controls that limit who can participate in the network.
- it operates `like centralized database systems` of today that `restrict` access to certain users
- Transactions that take place on a public blockchain are public.his means that anyone can see them take place. This is very much in `opposition to how society and traditional enterprises` have operated.

- Private blockchains solve this by `adding privacy controls` at the detriment of security. In practice, private blockchains act as a middle ground between traditional cloud computing and decentralized public blockchains.

# Public or Permissionless

- Public blockchains can't handle large quantities of transactions currently.

# Private or Permission

- existing infrastructure wherein the owner (a centralized authority) would have the power to change the rules, revert transactions, etc. based on the need.
