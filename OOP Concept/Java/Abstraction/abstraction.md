# Points to Remember

- http://www.visionsdeveloper.com/tutorial/java/java-abstraction.jsp
  -abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details from the user, only the functionality will be provided to the user.
- A method that is declare as abstract and does not have implementation is known as abstract method.
- Use abstraction if you know something needs to be in class but implementation of that varies.
- It can have `constructors` and `static` methods also.
