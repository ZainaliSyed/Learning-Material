# Points

- Like a class, an interface can have methods and variables
- all the methods in interface are declared with empty body and are public and all fields are public, static and final by default.
- It is also used to achieve loose coupling.
- `default` methods are only allow in interface

# Questions :

- Interfaces are used to implement abstraction. So the question arises why use interfaces when we have abstract classes?
- Reason : The reason is, abstract classes may contain non-final variables, whereas variables in interface are final, public and static. [reason](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/interfaces-in-java/)
